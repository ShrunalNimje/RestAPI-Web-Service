# RestAPI Web Service

This project demonstrates the implementation of a RESTful web service using Spring Boot. It provides APIs to perform basic CRUD operations and interact with a database. The service follows REST principles and is designed to be simple, scalable, and easy to extend.

## Features

- RESTful APIs for basic CRUD operations
- Supports JSON data format for requests and responses
- Error handling and response status codes
- Layered architecture (Controller, Service, Repository)
- Integrated with an in-memory H2 database (or configurable to other databases)

## Technologies Used

- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA
- H2 Database (can be configured to use SQL)
- Maven
- Docker (optional for deployment)

## Endpoints

The web service exposes the following API endpoints:

- `GET /api/entities` - Retrieve all entities
- `GET /api/entities/{id}` - Retrieve an entity by ID
- `POST /api/entities` - Create a new entity
- `PUT /api/entities/{id}` - Update an entity by ID
- `DELETE /api/entities/{id}` - Delete an entity by ID

## Prerequisites

- JDK 11 or higher
- Maven
- IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, etc.)
